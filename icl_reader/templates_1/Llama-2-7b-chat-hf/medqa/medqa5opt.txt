Make a choice based on the context and question. Take the following two questions as examples.

# Example 1
### Context:
Most outpatient physicians treat asymptomatic bacteriuria with sulfate-based cephalosporins such as nitrofurantoin (100 mg BID for 7 days) or cephalexin (500mg tid for 7 days). Both drugs are considered safe during pregnancy.

### Question:
A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination. She states it started 1 day ago and has been worsening despite drinking more water and taking cranberry extract. She otherwise feels well and is followed by a doctor for her pregnancy. Her temperature is 97.7\u00b0F (36.5\u00b0C), blood pressure is 122/77 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, respirations are 19/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an absence of costovertebral angle tenderness and a gravid uterus. Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient?
(A) Ampicillin
(B) Ceftriaxone
(C) Ciprofloxacin
(D) Doxycycline
(E) Nitrofurantoin

The answer is (E) Nitrofurantoin.

# Example 2
### Context:
Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the unexpected, sudden death of a child under one year old. An autopsy does not show an explainable cause of death in cases with SIDS. Placing the child in a supine position on a firm mattress while sleeping decreases the risk of SIDS by preventing potential hazards such as soft bedding material or entrapment risks that could compromise respiration.

### Question:
A 3-month-old baby died suddenly at night while asleep. His mother noticed that he had died only after she awoke in the morning. No cause of death was determined based on the autopsy. Which of the following precautions could have prevented the death of the baby?
(A) Placing the infant in a supine position on a firm mattress while sleeping
(B) Routine postnatal electrocardiogram (ECG)
(C) Keeping the infant covered and maintaining a high room temperature
(D) Application of a device to maintain the sleeping position
(E) Avoiding pacifier use during sleep

The answer is (A) Placing the infant in a supine position on a firm mattress while sleeping.

Now, help me with this question. Remember to answer with just a string of one line starting with "The answer is" as shown by the previous examples.
