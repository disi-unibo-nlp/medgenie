Make a choice based on the context and question. Take the following two questions as examples.

# Example 1
### Context:
Persistent obstruction of urine flow, as seen in benign prostatic hyperplasia, can result in increased pressure within the urinary system. This elevated pressure may eventually lead to atrophy of the kidney parenchyma. Atrophy refers to the shrinking or reduction in size of an organ or tissue, and in this context, it reflects the consequence of long-term obstruction on the affected kidney.

### Question:
Chronic urethral obstruction due to benign prismatic hyperplasia can lead to the following change in kidney parenchyma
(A) Hyperplasia
(B) Hyperophy
(C) Atrophy
(D) Dyplasia

The answer is (C) Atrophy.

# Example 2
### Context:
Vitamin B12, also known as cobalamin, is primarily found in animal products such as meat, fish, eggs, and dairy. It is not naturally present in significant amounts in plant-based foods, making it essential for individuals following a vegetarian or vegan diet to obtain this vitamin through fortified foods or supplements. In contrast, Vitamin C, Vitamin B7 (biotin), and Vitamin D can be obtained from both animal and plant sources.

### Question:
Which vitamin is supplied from only animal source:
(A) Vitamin B12
(B) Vitamin B7
(C) Vitamin C
(D) Vitamin D

The answer is (A) Vitamin B12.

Now, help me with this question. Remember to answer with just a string of one line starting with "The answer is" as shown by the previous examples.
