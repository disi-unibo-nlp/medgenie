### Context:
Antibiotic prophylaxis for infective endocarditis is indicated in individuals with predisposing cardiac conditions. In this scenario, determining if an isolated secundum ASD and mitral valve prolapse without regurgitation are associated with the potential risk of developing infective endocarditis requires further information. The presence of a prior coronary aery bypass graft and coarctation of aoa are both established indications for antibiotic prophylaxis due to their association with infective endocarditis risk.

### Question:
Antiboiotic Prophylaxis for infective endocarditis is indicated in:
(A) Isolated secundum ASD
(B) Mitral valve prolapse without regurgitation
(C) Prior coronary aery bypass graft
(D) Coarctation of aoa<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

(D) Coarctation of aoa.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>
