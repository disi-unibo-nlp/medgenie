Context: Schneider's first-rank symptoms (SRS) were initially described in individuals with schizophrenia and subsequently found to occur in other psychiatric disorders, as well as many neurologic conditions. SRS include:\n\n1.\u00a0Hallucination\u00a0(auditory, visual, olfactory/gustatory tactile): Audible thoughts; voices heard arguing or discussing or giving a running commentary on one's action or thought; voices of a person who are not real but are discussed with the patient as if they were present (third person hallucinations). Acoustic/olfactory manifestations experienced simultaneously by others nearby. 2 Thought attention phenomena Thought insertion and withdrawal; thought broadcasting; made feelings (affect); made impulses ('made needs'); Made volition ('made voluntary actions'); Somatic passivity phenomena: Cutaneous tactile sensation that is experienced as being put into egs., burned, cut). Other symptoms from the original description which may be included under this term:- 'Made' feelings ('affect').- 'Made'-volitions'. Sudden delusional ideas without an immediate recognizable affective response.- Depressive and euphoric mood changes for which there is no obvious external cause/- Experiences of bodily change for which there is no physical cause-. Altered perception of body size.- Perplexity,- Capgras syndrome - Delusional jealousy / Jalousie apparentee - Foreign accent syndrome / Accent surcharge/'Switchlanguage'. Note: If only one point attenuates the diagnosis by only 1 criterion than take it into consideration but proceed towards diagnosing if other points strengthen diagnosis\nSchneider's First-Rank Symptoms (FRS) are a set of peculiarities of speech, action, and behavior that were observed by the Swiss psychiatrist Kurt Schneider in the late 19th century to be pathognomonic (distinctive) signs of schizophrenia.\nThese symptoms include:\n- Thought echo/insertion/withdrawal\n- Voices heard arguing or discussing or giving commands to the individual in third person.\u00a0(command hallucinations).\n- Somatic passivity experiences\u00a0such as feeling imposed upon by external forces. \u00a0(feeling controlled). Feeling like one\u2019s own thoughts are not one\u2019s own ideas but rather have been placed into one\u2019s mind by outside forces .or as if an external force is acting through upon on them and they have no control over their actions at certain times due to this influence from outside source .as if some unseen part is acting independently on person with intent to harm or mislead them (control /will -Automatism phenomenon)\nPattern understanding : Delusion explanation for life events & experiences which contains several elements from ordinary life & involves only slight elaboration from ordinary occurrences.Absurdity:- Flight =of ideas; where associations between real concepts are loosely linked without any meaningful connections ideation flowing too fast whose connection can neither be followed nor understood.(Neologisms)(verbigeration); direct speech with loss of coherence thought disorderInvectiveness :- Excessively bitter complaints & continuous nagging about imagined wrongdoings especially vindictive hostility towards close family members who put such complainants \"on guard\".Stockholm Syndrome -This neurotic condition occurs when a captive begins to identify more closely with his/her captors than previously experienced identified hostile behavior directed toward others perceived as responsible for ones suffering (\"turned against\" self)& internalized hatred expressed through prolonged submission.- Simulating mental illness people act insane may pretend multiple personalities ,epilepsy amnesia Sexual Deviation Anorexia Nervosa Pseudologia Fantastica All these impulse control disorders was given name based On FRS By K Schnieder ; he also gave names for other spectrum Catatonia Disorder Amphetamine Psychosis Blunt trauma dementia Drug\nKurt Schneider's First-Rank Symptoms of Schizophrenia:\n- Audible thoughts/thought echo/ thought insertion - Hallucinations\n- Voices arguing or discussing about the pt in 3rd person - Hallucinations\n- Voices commenting on one's action simultaneously with the action - Hallucination/passivity phenomenon. (Similar experience may be had with Cocaine)\u00a0\n- Thought withdrawal or diffusion due to emotional stress (Thought broadcast)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Hallucination and delusion disorder of schizophrenia, which is not clearly differentiated from psychosis. It belongs in between psychosis and neurosis. Those who suffer from this disorder are uncomfortable about their experiences but do not feel overly distressed. They realize that their belief is absurd/delusional, but they cannot control these symptoms even though they know it\u2019s wrong for them. These types were described by the Swiss Psychiatrist Kurt Schneider as highest krankheit \u2014 a \"symptom\" that was often accompanied by other hallmark signs of schizophrenia, such as auditory hallucinations\u2014this time ones involving voices commanding patients to act against their will\u2014or delusions like an invisible steel thread that runs through one\u2019s body preventing movement unless influenced otherwise by something outside the person ego boundaries(dissosiation). Many mental health practitioners consider his descriptions pivotal when looking at signs related to all kinds of pathologies including more serious diagnoses such as Paranoid type & catatonic type Schizoaffective Disorders according to ICD& DSM V classification systems . His theories have been adapted extensively into modern day diagnostic standards particularly Identifying certain types of thinking disturbance which he coined Magical Thinking / Arbitrary inference / Inference & fantasy thinking etc...throughout different levels depending upon whether its prominent present only inside primary delusions , in bizarre ideas or also observed clinically while assessings Only secondarily manifested through acting out behavior due Neologism formation(making up new words never heard before ) seen commonly seen very agitated during episodes Second rank symptoms : includes poor attention span associated impairment concentration resulting distractibility intermittent lapses memory Tactile halluconzlstias Mechanicalex\nBleuler's classification of the symptoms of schizophrenia into first rank, second rank and third rank symptoms.\nSchneider First Rank Symptoms (SFRS) are a set of behavioral and psychological signs identified and described by Kurt Schneider in 1959 that, according to the DSM-IV, \"are useful for identifying individuals with schizophrenia\"\u00a0\nThese symptoms include: Voices arguing or discussing or both (voices heard arguing); Voices commenting on one's action; Made feelings; Made impulses; Thought withdrawal (e.g., thought insertion, thought broadcasting); Delusional perception/thinking;; and Passivity phenomena.
