### Context:
Hyperviscosity is a condition where the blood becomes abnormally thick, hindering its ability to flow properly. Cryoglobulinemia is a condition characterized by abnormal antibodies in the blood (antibodies are specialized cells that recognize and attack foreign invaders). These abnormal antibodies become solid at cold temperatures and lead to clumping of red blood cells, an increase in viscosity, and subsequent obstruction of small vessels.

### Question:
Hyper viscosity is seen in
(A) Cryoglobulinemia
(B) Multiple myeloma
(C) MGUS
(D) Lymphoma</s>
