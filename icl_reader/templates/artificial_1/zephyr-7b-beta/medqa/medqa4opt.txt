### Context:
Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the unexpected, sudden death of a child under one year old. An autopsy does not show an explainable cause of death in cases with SIDS. Placing the child in a supine position on a firm mattress while sleeping decreases the risk of SIDS by preventing potential hazards such as soft bedding material or entrapment risks that could compromise respiration.
